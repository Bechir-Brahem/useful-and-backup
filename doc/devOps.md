# azure trick

i had an account azure with my insat email and verified it that gave me 100$ and a student subscription.
then when i consumed my 100$ my account got disabled i did this to get another 100$:

1. remove insat email from github account
2. connect to azure with that github account to make a new azure account with it
3. go to learning or to students azure and try to verify that i am a student with my insat email this worked for me
4. you can then add your insat email back to github
